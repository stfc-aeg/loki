# This configuration file is used by the loki-config init script to allow the overriding of default
# modules and static resources with arbitrary replacements. To enable the override, set
# conf_OVERRIDE_PRODUCTION to 1, or to disable auto-launching of the detector odin-control instance,
# set conf_DO_NOT_START to 1. If options are not set, the defaults will be used.

# This configuration can be complimented with an additional script, which will be executed before these
# locations are accessed (see conf_INITIAL_SETUP_SCRIPT_*). Therefore it can be used to mount network
# filesystems which might host the python virtual environment, for example. This allows further
# arbitrary control beyond the provided options.

# Version of this config for compatibility with loki installation. Do not modify unless config has been
# updated to match default config for that loki version.

# control detector and resources.

# If set 1, odin-control will not be started, ignoring the state of conf_OVERRIDE_PRODUCTION.
conf_DO_NOT_START=0

# Set to 0 to only use ssh keys that have been included in the image rather than those persistently held
# in flash. If set 0, any keys added to /home/loki/.ssh/authorized_keys will be lost. If set 1, the flash
# copy of .ssh will be bind mounted over the image's version (with any unique keys in the image duplicated).
conf_PERSISTENT_SSH_AUTH=1

# If enabled, the initial setup script will be run before any of the resources specified in this file
# are accessed. It can therefore be used to set up network mounts where these resources might be
# located, as well as perform any required arbitrary setup tasks that might be needed to ensure
# combatibility with the current installation.
