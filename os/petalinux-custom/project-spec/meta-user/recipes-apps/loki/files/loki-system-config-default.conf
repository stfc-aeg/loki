# This configuration file specifies settings for the LOKI system as a whole. These can be overridden in
# either an eMMC file loki-config/loki-system-config.conf, or on the network mount using the layout.conf
# setting LOKI_CONFIG_FILENAME.

# Version of this config for compatibility with loki installation. Do not modify unless config has been
# updated to match default config for that loki version.

# Set to 0 to only use ssh keys that have been included in the image rather than those persistently held
# in flash. If set 0, any keys added to /home/loki/.ssh/authorized_keys will be lost. If set 1, the flash
# copy of .ssh will be bind mounted over the image's version (with any unique keys in the image duplicated).

# If enabled, the initial setup script will be run before any of the resources specified in this file
# are accessed. It can therefore be used to set up network mounts where these resources might be
# located, as well as perform any required arbitrary setup tasks that might be needed to ensure
# combatibility with the current installation.
